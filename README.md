# Introduction

Hello viewer and welcome to my submission for Challenge 5 aka the pymaceuticals challenge. For context, at the time of writing this, I am enrolled in the Data Analytics and Visualizations bootcamp with the University of MN. We are assigned a challenge homework per module. This is Module 5's challenge on Python. I am using a windows/PC laptop.

# Overview

In this specific challenge we stepped into the role of a senior data analyst at a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. We were given complete data from their most recent animal study that included 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors that received treatment with a range of drug regimens over the course of 45 days. We were challenged to compare the performance of our drug of interest (Capomulin) against other drugs. 

# Additional Information/Citations

In this repository, you will find the starter code we were provided that includes a template of what to code and what the visualizations should look like if done correctly, a data folder with two csv files holding the complete data from the study, and my analysis folder which I named "Pymaceuticals-Analysis-ALee." Special shout out to my tutor Geronimo Perez who helped me when I got stuck two different times. He helped me generate a summary statistics table showing the mean, median, standard deviation, and SEM in one step and he also taught me "flierprops=" which adds additional parameters. I used this in the Quartiles, Outliers, and Boxplots section. I also used google and youtube to search for quick answers helpful websites. They are cited below. Otherwise, everything else was retained information gathered from my classes and class activities. The most helpful were lessons 5.2 (Plotting with Pandas) and 5.3 (Introduction to Statistics). As always shout out to my bootcamp TAs Sam and Randy for all their help answering my questions during office hours, my instructor Hunter for always being clear in his articulation of the course material, and my classmates for their encouragement and support.
